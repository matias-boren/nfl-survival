## 2. PRD #1: Pick Reminders + "Almost Locked" Banner

**Title:** Smart Pick Reminders & Lock Warning System  
**Problem:** 35% of users miss weekly picks due to forgetting or not knowing lock times, leading to elimination and churn.  
**Goal / Metric:** Primary: Increase on-time pick rate from 65% to 80%. Secondary: Reduce weekly churn by 15%, improve user satisfaction scores.  
**Audience / JTBD:** All active users who want to stay competitive in their leagues without constantly checking lock times.

**Solution (MVP):**
- **Notification System:** T-24h ("Week X picks open"), T-2h ("Picks lock soon"), T-15m ("Final warning") 
- **Home Banner:** "Almost Locked! X minutes remaining" when <2 hours to lock
- **Pick Screen:** Countdown timer with color coding (green>2h, yellow<2h, red<30m)
- **Smart Suppression:** Skip notifications if user already picked
- **Timezone Handling:** All times rendered in user's local timezone

**Free vs Premium Behavior:**
- Free: Basic reminders (T-24h, T-2h only)
- Premium: All reminders + custom timing preferences

**Out-of-Scope:** 
- Custom notification text per user
- SMS reminders
- Calendar integration
- Multiple league reminder consolidation

**Instrumentation:**
```json
Events: notification_sent, notification_opened, banner_viewed, banner_clicked, pick_after_reminder
Properties: reminder_type, time_to_lock, user_timezone, league_count
Dashboard: Reminder effectiveness, pick timing distribution, churn correlation
```

**Variants (A/B):**
- **A:** Standard timing (T-24h, T-2h, T-15m)
- **B:** Aggressive timing (T-48h, T-4h, T-30m, T-5m)
- **C:** Personalized timing based on user's historical pick patterns

**Risks & Mitigations:**
- **Risk:** Notification fatigue ‚Üí **Mitigation:** Frequency caps, easy opt-out
- **Risk:** Timezone bugs ‚Üí **Mitigation:** Comprehensive timezone testing
- **Risk:** Server load on reminder dispatch ‚Üí **Mitigation:** Batch processing, queue management

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Quantitative: 80% on-time pick rate, <2% notification complaint rate, 99.9% delivery accuracy
- Qualitative: User feedback scores >4.0, no timezone-related support tickets

**Estimate:** S (2 weeks) - leveraging existing notification infrastructure

**Appendix:**
```
Notification Templates:
T-24h: "‚ö° Week X picks are open! Lock in your survivor pick before Thursday 8:20 PM"
T-2h: "‚è∞ Picks lock in 2 hours! Don't get eliminated - make your Week X pick now"
T-15m: "üö® FINAL WARNING: Picks lock in 15 minutes! Tap to pick now"

Banner Copy: "‚ö° Almost Locked! {X} minutes remaining to make your Week {Y} pick"
```

## 3. PRD #2: Premium Multi-League Dashboard + Live Score Widgets

**Title:** Premium Multi-League Command Center  
**Problem:** Premium users managing multiple leagues lack a unified view, reducing engagement and perceived value of subscription.  
**Goal / Metric:** Primary: Increase premium user session frequency by 40%. Secondary: Improve premium retention by 25%, increase feature adoption to 80%.  
**Audience / JTBD:** Premium subscribers who participate in multiple leagues and want efficient league management and real-time updates.

**Solution (MVP):**
- **Dashboard Overview:** All leagues in card format with key stats (survivors, your status, next deadline)
- **Live Score Widgets:** Real-time scores for games affecting your picks, embedded in feed
- **Quick Actions:** One-tap pick submission across leagues, bulk operations
- **Status Indicators:** Visual health check (picked/not picked, safe/at risk, eliminated)
- **League Comparison:** Side-by-side performance across leagues

**Free vs Premium Behavior:**
- Free: Single league view only, no live scores, static data
- Premium: Multi-league dashboard, live scores, real-time updates, advanced filters

**Out-of-Scope:**
- League creation from dashboard
- Cross-league pick copying
- Advanced analytics/reporting
- Commissioner tools integration

**Instrumentation:**
```json
Events: dashboard_view, league_card_click, quick_pick_submit, live_score_view, widget_interaction
Properties: league_count, pick_status, score_update_frequency, session_duration
Dashboard: Feature adoption rate, engagement lift, premium retention correlation
```

**Variants (A/B):**
- **A:** Card-based layout with horizontal scroll
- **B:** List-based layout with vertical scroll
- **C:** Hybrid layout with priority league featured

**Risks & Mitigations:**
- **Risk:** Live score API costs ‚Üí **Mitigation:** Smart caching, rate limiting
- **Risk:** Performance with many leagues ‚Üí **Mitigation:** Pagination, lazy loading
- **Risk:** Data sync issues ‚Üí **Mitigation:** Offline-first architecture, conflict resolution

- Qualitative: User satisfaction >4.2, premium value perception increase

**Estimate:** L (4 weeks) - new UI patterns, live data integration, performance optimization
